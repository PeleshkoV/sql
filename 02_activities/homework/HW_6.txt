Ethics & inequity

I believe ethics starts from your personality. I have a rule: if you have some questions to society or concerns,
always start by asking yourself. What did you do to escape this situation? What could you do but did not? 
How could/ can help people around you? Etc. It's so easy to blame someone or something instead of your  
actions or reflections. According to this statement, the most unacceptable behavior for me is indifference 
including at work.   

For almost all my previous career, I have worked in the HR field and communication. I have been working with 
large amounts of information, doing research, analytics, creating texts and documents. There have always been 
people behind this work. I knew how my work could impact others. Even if I worked in analytics and data, 
it was also about people's relation, their salaries, benefits, satisfaction etc. That's why attention to detail 
must be. The last sql-lesson was inspiring for me. The real cases that we discussed reminded me 
to dive deeper sometimes into social, political, historical and cultural aspects at my work, 
even if I work with data.      

I have one more rule in my professional and private life that helps me to keep ethics and respect equity. 
It sounds simple but it's impactful: 'Treat people the way you want them to treat you'.
